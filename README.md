# The Implementation of the Novel Similarity Classifier on Python
## Motivation
I write this code based on `Christoph Lohrmann, Pasi Luukka - A novel similarity classifier with multiple ideal vectors based on k-means clustering (2018)` 
[Paper URL](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167923618300708)

I haven't found any code like this on any website (or search engine). So I decided to write it based on what I understand on the above paper. Because Data Science is not my major,  this code may not fully express the idea of the above paper.

I will be happy if my code can help you to do something.

## Issues

Low accuracy for PCA data, I will fix it when I have square time :)  

## Dataset
[Statlog (German Credit Data) Data Set Numeric Version](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data))
